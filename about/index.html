			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a transportation and urban geographer. My research interests include transportation modeling, urban form/morphology study, and interactions between transportation and urban development. My dissertation work focuses on potential development of high-speed rail (HSR) in the United States. More specifically, I am interested in how HSR competes with existing modes of inter-city transportation (i.e., air and auto travel) in sprawling cities (as opposed to in compact cities)</p>
