			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a transportation and urban geographer. My research interests include transportation modeling, urban form/morphology study, and more importantly, interactions and dynamics between transportation and urban development. My dissertation work focuses on potential development of high-speed rail (HSR) in the United States. More specifically, I am interested in how HSR competes with existing modes of inter-city transportation (i.e., air and auto travel) from an accessibility perspective, and what are the impacts of different urban forms (i.e., compact cities vs. sprawling cities).</p>
