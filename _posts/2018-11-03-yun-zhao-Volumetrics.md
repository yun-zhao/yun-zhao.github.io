## Summary
This study introduces a suite of 3D spatial pattern metrics that can be computed on gradient surfaces such as digital surface models, but are rooted in traditional, patch-based landscape metrics that are familiar and interpretable across landscape contexts. We compute a suite of 3D metrics and demonstrate their use by analyzing a landscape pattern in the built environment of New Orleans in 2002 and 2008â€”pre- and post- Hurricane Katrina. Lidar data are used to segment individual buildings and calculate 3D patterns at the equivalent of the patch-, class- and landscape-levels for traditional landscape metrics. 

The metrics calculation package are published as GIS scripting tools for open access and usage. 

## Illustration

The below figure shows the visualization of gradient surface (digital height model; DHM) of landscape object heights for downtown New Orleans derived from lidar in both 2D and 3D.
