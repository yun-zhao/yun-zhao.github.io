## Summary
This study evaluates the feasibility of high-speed rail in the United States based on a newly proposed **door-to-door travel time (DTDTT) approach**. The proposed DTDTT approach incporates trip segments within cities (such as trips made to access and egress from train station and airports), and is able to delineate HSR advantages over existing air and auto travels within cities in a spaitally explicit way.  A case study is carried out using the Dallas-Houston corridor to analyze and visualize how the proposed HSR service competes with existing intercity travel modes, including air and auto travels. The study provides more meaningful ways to perform HSR feasibility study, and helps transportation and urban planners make informed decisions on the possible adoption of HSR in the US context.   

## Illustration

The below figure illustrates the key segments of intercity trips to represent the proposed door-to-door travel time approach.

Here is a map showing the proposed high-speed rail line between Dallas and Houston, along with existing trasnsportation infrastructures the support inter-city travels, such as airports and interstate highway.

This below figure is an visualization of produced by the proposed method, showing advantages of different travel modes in Houston.  Red area indicates where HSR will have shorter total travel time, green area indicate areas where Airport Hobby will have advantage, and Purple indicate areas where Airport Geirge Bush will have advantage.
