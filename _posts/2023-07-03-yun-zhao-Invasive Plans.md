# Using Convolutional and Rrcurrent Neural Netowrks (CNN & RNN) for Invasive Plants Detection

## Summary
This study develops a novel deep learning model using a UAS and associated
geographic information system (GIS) to detect and identify invasive Phragmites australis (PA) in its early growth stage.
This novel network, integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN), proves to be
an efficient and accurate method to detect PA in time series UAS images. CNN is good at extracting spatial features on
images, and RNN excels in processing temporal features. Temporal features of the time series UAS images are extracted
and employed with spatial features for the classification by an RNN model. Experiments are conducted in Nature Conservancyâ€™s
Emiquon Preserve. The proposed network achieves the highest performance compared with other IP detection
models. With its high generalization ability, the proposed model might find more applications in precision agriculture and
land conservation areas.
