## Summary
Aerosols not only affect air quality and human health, but also impact global climate change through direct and indirect radiative forcing. Deposited aerosols can impact nutrients and toxic element availability, ocean biogeochemistry, primary productivity, and carbon cycling. It is thus critical to understand the role and cycle of aerosols as a contributing factor in this issues. In this study, **Six years of hourly aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data retrieved from Himawari-8** were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variations, especially diurnal variations, of aerosols over the China Seas. The spatial feature showed that AOT over high latitude seas was generally larger than over low latitude seas, and it is distributed in strips along the coastline and decreases gradually with increasing distance from the coastline. The monthly variation in AOT showed a pronounced annual cycle. Seasonal variations of the spatial pattern showed that the largest AOT was usually observed in spring and varies in other seasons for different seas.

## Illustration

The below figure illustrates the workflow and key findings of this study. The left graph shows the design of this study: two data sources were used and validated to map out the spatila distribution of ocean AOT. On the right, AOT variations were plotted/mapped at the diurnal, monthly, and seasonal levels, with some common traits identified.
