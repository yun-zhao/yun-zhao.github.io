## Summary
For nine U.S. cities, we test whether scatterometer data can be used to estimate 3D urban built-up volume. We found strong, linear correlations between the lidar-derived and radar-derived building volume estimates for all cities with r2 values as high as 0.98 when using spatial trend analysis. Given the high expense that limits lidar data acquisition to small areas at sporadic points in time, satellite scatterometer data provide a breakthrough method for monitoring both vertical growth and horizontal expansion of cities across the world with a continuous decadal time scale.    

## Illustration

The below figure illustrates the data processing and analytical workflow.

Here are two 3D visualizations of lidar data for Austin, TX and Washington, DC.

This below figure shows city and data extents along with raw and processed data and polynomial trend visualizations for Austin, TX (left) and Washington, DC (right). Figure includes: (a) reference map, (b) 1 m lidar LR-DHM, (c) 1 km radar DSM, (d) 1 km aggregated lidar data (buildings only), (e) radar trend surface, and (f) lidar trend surface. The strong correlations between the trended radar DSM product and the trended lidar data, the DSM product is able to capture general urban volume trends, which means the radar DSM product is able to sufficiently capture heavy urban development. These results provide evidence that the trended DSM product is ap- propriate for relative measures of urban volume.
