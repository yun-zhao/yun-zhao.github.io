	<p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a Ph.D candidate in Geography at Oklahoma State University. Head to  <strong>About</strong> to find a brief introduction of my research interests and experiences. A complete CV can be downloaded under <strong>CV</strong>. The <strong>Project</strong> tab (still under construction) lists all the research projects I’ve worked for during my time as a graduate student. </p>
